# Photonic Balanced-Ternary Computer

This project explores a **balanced-ternary (âˆ’1, 0, +1)** computer architecture built using **integrated photonics**.

### Components
- **Simulator:** Java-based photonic dot-product simulator.
- **Hardware:** Detailed MAC design for photonic logic.
- **Bridge:** Binary-to-ternary emulator layer.
- **Docs:** Research and phase plans.
- **Results:** Simulation outputs and analysis.

Run the simulator:
```bash
cd simulator
javac *.java utils/*.java
java PhotonicDotProductSimulator
