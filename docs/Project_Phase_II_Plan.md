# **Project: Photonic Balanced-Ternary Computer — Phase II Plan**

## **Overview**

This document formalizes the **Phase II roadmap** for the **Photonic Balanced-Ternary Computing Platform**, integrating the latest simulation findings from the *coherent photonic dot-product experiments*. It outlines the next engineering steps — from software-based parametric simulation to photonic hardware definition — and defines a structured billing and development framework.

---

## **Phase II Context**

Recent simulations demonstrate that a **balanced ternary photonic architecture** (−1, 0, +1) can rival or exceed binary logic in *energy efficiency per MAC operation* under coherent detection:

| Mode        | SNR (dB) | E/MAC (fJ) | Efficiency (Binary_E / Ternary_E)    |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Binary**  | 38.7     | 4800       | —                                    |
| **Ternary** | 33.9     | 5800       | **0.827×** *(≈17% energy advantage)* |

**Interpretation:**
Ternary photonic computation can deliver lower effective energy per arithmetic operation — especially when ADC costs are amortized across WDM channels or analog accumulation networks.
